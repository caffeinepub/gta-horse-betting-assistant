  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all six requirements (REQ-64 through REQ-69). The PredictionAndResults.tsx component has been redesigned with the three-section layout (header with strategy mode and odds/implied probabilities, primary panel with best bet details, secondary panel with signal breakdown). The statsCalculator.ts has been extended to expose individual signal components through calculateSignalBreakdownForContender and identifyHotAndTrapBuckets functions. All acceptance criteria appear to be implemented based on the evidence in the diff.",
