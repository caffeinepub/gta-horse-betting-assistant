  "summary": "The implementation comprehensively addresses all six requirements (REQ-23 through REQ-28). AsyncStorage wrapper with four keys is implemented with error handling, immutable race records with all 13 required fields are defined and enforced via deep freeze, derived stats can be rebuilt from the races array, race logging is integrated into PredictionAndResults with async storage operations, and ROIDashboard reads from AsyncStorage instead of backend. All acceptance criteria are met with strong type safety and immutability enforcement.",
